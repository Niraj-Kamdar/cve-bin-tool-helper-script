# cve-bin-tool-helper-script
This repository contains helper scripts for cve-bin-tool

1) **binary_package_downloader** which downloads specified binary of a package for both debian and centos and also generate a json file which helps writing long_test in test_scanner.
2) **analyser** which analyse both binary file and outputs similar_strings(helps writing guess contains), debian_version_strings and centos_version_strings (help writing pattern string).
Though these scripts aren't  good enough to work by its own but It is good enough to make checker writing process very easy.
