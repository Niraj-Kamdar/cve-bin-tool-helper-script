# cve-bin-tool-helper-script
This repository contains helper scripts for cve-bin-tool

Note: currently only supports windows

1) **binary_package_downloader** which downloads specified binary of a package for both debian and centos and also generate a json file which helps writing long_test in test_scanner.
2) **analyser** which analyse both binary file and outputs similar_strings(helps writing guess contains), debian_version_strings and centos_version_strings (help writing pattern string).
Though these scripts aren't  good enough to work by its own but It is good enough to make checker writing process very easy. 
3) **test_c_file_generator** which creates test_c_file for the test_scanner to test checker on it.

Idea is to make Rule base analyser which provides best version pattern string for all distributions. output of this analyser can be used to automatically create checker, test file and change test_scanner for the given package.

As a proof of concept, I have feed curl package to these scripts and output for that can be found in curl directory which includes possible candidates for version strings in different distro with test_c_file generated for curl.
1) [debian_version_string](./curl/debian_version_string)
2) [centos_version_string](./curl/centos_version_string)
3) [test_curl_file](./curl/test-curl-7.32.0)
4) [similar_string](./curl/similar_string)
